# Object

Object is a project designed to bridge the consumer and the product. It provides a simple interface to quickly scan the Object logo and return a checkout for the product. Similar to QR codes, but totally custom and unobtrusive. It works by scanning images in realtime and sending them to the backend to be analyzed. The image is then filtered to remove as much noise as possible, then analyzed for the color sequence in the ring. If the color sequence is known the checkout URL is returned and the user is redirected to the product checkout page. The ideal process is then:

1. Open the [o-bject.is](http://www.o-bject.is/) url.
2. Hover the camera overlay over the object logo.
3. Redirect automatically to the corresponding product.
4. Purchase.

In the ideal situation the user will already have been a Shopify user and have their details autofilled and have a payment service connected so that they can essentially confirm their details and order.
